# FIXME: This Terraform HCL file defines the 3 master nodes.  It uses the original ironic_nodes.json format,
# flattened because Terraform v0.11 does not support nested data structures.  Maps may only be key/value
# pairs.  We could use terraform's resource `count` provider to have just one resource declaration, but
# the data would have to be structured differently.
